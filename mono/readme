This QuickUI folder contains the tools and associated files for using QuickUI under OS/X.

The \lib folder contains the QuickUI .NET binaries (qb.exe and qc.exe), as well as the quickui.js file required at runtime.
The \bin folder contains bash shell scripts for running the .NET binaries on OS/X via mono.

To install on OS/X:
1. Download Mono from http://www.mono-project.com. Mono allows .NET executables such as the QuickUI tools to run under OS/X and Linux.
2. Copy the contents of this QuickUI folder to a location such as /Developer/Applications/QuickUI.
3. Add the location of the bin folder from step #2, e.g., /Developer/Applications/QuickUI/bin, to your path.
4. If you installed in a location other than /Developer/Applications/QuickUI, then update the qb and qc scripts in the bin folder to point to the location you used.
